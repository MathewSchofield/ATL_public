This is a short explanation of how DR.py works.

DR.py runs using Python 2.7. The code is made up of functions, 
which are called inside '__main__'. 2 example stars are defined 
(as parameters inside numpy arrays) at the start of '__main__'. 
To replace these stars with your star list, simply load the list from a file
(e.g with numpy.loadtxt()).

Alternatively, import any individual functions you wish to use into another Python script.

The code requires at least the V-band magnitude, (B-V) colour, position in
ecliptic and galactic coordinates, parallax and parallax uncertainty.
You will also need a way of determining whether the stars are dwarfs or giants
(this adjusts the relations used to calculate I-band magnitude in BV2VI()).

The more information you have on the stars, the fewer functions you will need to run.
For example, if you have the I-band or TESS magnitudes for the star, you will not need
to calculate them in the code so do not need to run the BV2VI() function.

When calculating the observing time in the TESS field for each star, the tess_field_only()
function outputs the total number of sectors that the star will be observed for,
and the maximum contiguous number ('max_T'). 'max_T' should be used to calculate the
detection probability Pdet.

Lastly, the globalDetections() function calculates Pdet. there is a keyword argument
for globalDetections() called vary_beta. To get a realistic estimate of how likely
you are to detect the Gaussian envelope for your stars, SET vary_beta TO TRUE.
This will suppress modes of oscillation close to the delta-Scuti instability strip.
Setting this to False will not suppress modes, and gives a very optimistic Pdet prediction.
